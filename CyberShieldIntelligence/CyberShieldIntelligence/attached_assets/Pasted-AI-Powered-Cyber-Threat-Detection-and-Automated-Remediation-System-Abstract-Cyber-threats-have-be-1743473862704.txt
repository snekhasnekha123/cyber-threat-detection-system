AI-Powered Cyber Threat Detection and Automated Remediation System
Abstract:
Cyber threats have become increasingly sophisticated, posing significant risks to organizations and individuals. Traditional cybersecurity measures rely on static rule-based approaches, which often fail to detect zero-day attacks and evolving cyber threats. This project presents an AI-driven threat detection and automated remediation system, which leverages machine learning, deep learning, and cryptographic techniques to enhance cybersecurity. The system continuously analyzes incoming network traffic, system logs, and user behavior to identify anomalies and potential security threats such as malware, phishing attacks, and unauthorized access attempts. It integrates real-time monitoring, automated threat mitigation, and secure cryptographic solutions into a user-friendly Flask-based web application. By implementing predictive analytics and adaptive learning, the system significantly improves cybersecurity defenses, reducing human intervention and response time.
Software and Hardware Requirements:
Software Requirements:
•	Programming Language: Python
•	Framework: Flask (for web application development)
•	Libraries: Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/PyTorch, Pandas, NumPy, PyCryptodome, Matplotlib, Plotly, OpenCV (for potential image-based threat detection)
•	Operating System: Windows/Linux/Mac
•	Development Environment: Jupyter Notebook, PyCharm, VS Code
•	Web Technologies: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (for frontend design)
Hardware Requirements:
•	Processor: Intel i5/i7 or AMD equivalent
•	RAM: Minimum 8GB (Recommended 16GB for deep learning models)
•	Storage: Minimum 50GB free space
•	GPU: NVIDIA GPU (Optional for deep learning acceleration)

Existing System Disadvantages:
1.	Limited Accuracy: Traditional rule-based threat detection systems often fail to recognize advanced cyber threats, leading to ineffective security measures.
2.	High False Positives: Many existing systems generate a large number of false alarms, making it difficult to distinguish genuine threats from false alerts.
3.	Slow Response Time: Manual threat detection and remediation result in delays, giving attackers more time to exploit vulnerabilities.
4.	Lack of Predictive Capabilities: Traditional security models do not use AI to forecast potential attacks before they occur.
5.	Inability to Handle Large-Scale Attacks: Conventional cybersecurity systems struggle to analyze vast amounts of security logs and real-time traffic efficiently.
6.	No Automated Remediation: Existing solutions lack automated response mechanisms, requiring human intervention for threat mitigation.

Proposed System Advantages:
1.	AI-Powered Detection: Implements machine learning and deep learning to enhance accuracy in detecting cyber threats.
2.	Real-Time Security Monitoring: Provides an interactive dashboard that enables continuous threat analysis and alert generation.
3.	Automated Threat Remediation: The system automatically triggers response actions such as blocking malicious IPs, quarantining infected files, and alerting security personnel.
4.	Adaptive Learning & Self-Improvement: The AI model learns from past security incidents, continuously improving its detection capabilities.
5.	Advanced Cryptographic Security: Ensures data protection through AES encryption, hashing algorithms, and secure authentication mechanisms.
6.	User-Friendly Flask Web Application: The system is accessible via a simple, interactive, and intuitive web interface.
7.	Reduced False Positives: AI-driven threat classification minimizes false alarms, improving security efficiency.
8.	Scalability and Integration: Designed to be integrated with existing SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) solutions, making it adaptable for enterprise security systems.
